Title: **Distribution and ecohydrologic function of pinyon pine and juniper woodland species using national longitudinal surveys**

## Abstract

Pinyon (*Pinus* spp.) - juniper (*Juniperus* spp.) woodlands are a common ecosystem type across the western USA that have historically and are actively experiencing expansion and infilling with risk of ecosystem losses in ecohydrologic function and soil erosion. Excluding anthropogenic influences on ecosystem development (e.g., alterations to historical fire and climatic regimes), the specific bioclimatic and topo-edaphic determinants of PJ woodland establishment, especially the species that comprise them, are poorly understood. Assessment of species-level dynamics with on-the-ground (e.g., â‰¤ 30 m^2) indicators of ecosystem functioning is difficult with available satellite remote sensing techniques. Using ground-based plot samples, we present current (2009-2021) PJ woodland and species regional domains modeled from multiple longitudinal assessment and monitoring frameworks across the western USA with potential factors driving or controlling their presence. We further evaluated the ecohydrological function of PJ woodlands as tree densities ostensibly increase and those regional domains where functioning may be declining (or already declined). Our PJ woodland ecosystem-type random forest classification model had an accuracy of 61.6% with species-level models ranging from 52% to 99%. The top model determinants of PJ woodland ecosystems were wet-season temperature, precipitation seasonality, warm-season precipitation, seasonal drought temperature, and isothermality. Total warm-season precipitation, wet-season temperature, and precipitation seasonality were among the top discriminant variables between PJ species. High PJ densities were found to reduce species richness and total perennial grass and forb cover in consequence of increasing bare ground cover, inducing the potential for soil surface erosion (e.g., reduced ecohydrologic function). Taken together, increasing PJ species density and woodland ecosystem cover may come at the risk of loss to plant understory richness, livestock and native herbivore forage, and surface soils in absence of management intervention or fire. These national longitudinal surveys provided valuable ecosystem- and species-level detail to assess trends in both natural and agricultural resources.
